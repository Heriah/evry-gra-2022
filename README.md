# Workshops of the course *Asset Management* - Evry University

This *repo* is dedicated to the 3 workshops of my course *Asset Management* for the Master *Gestion des Risques et des Actifs* at Evry University.

See [AFG report](https://www.afg.asso.fr/afg-document/rapport-dactivite-2021/) pages 6-7 for the key figures of the French AM industry.

Before each workshop, the results will be disclosed on real data with only some R codes: only files .md will be at disposal and not source files .Rmd. 

The 4th workshop will be dedicated to R Markdown and its use to create the report for the course: see [this book chapter](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/r-markdown.html) for more precisions on R Markdown.

Before the first workshop, each student has to follow these 4 steps:

1. download R from [__R project__](https://www.r-project.org/).
2. download the free version of RStudio from [__RStudio__](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/).
3. download the packages __tidyverse__, __readxl__, __DataExplorer__, __scales__ with the function `install.packages(c("tidyverse", "readxl", "DataExplorer", "scales"))`.
4. download [__Excel add-in__](https://www.quandl.com/tools/excel) of Quandl.
